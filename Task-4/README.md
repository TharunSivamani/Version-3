# Task-4

> write a simple 4 layer convolution neural network, to be trained on MNIST. While the training is going on, i want to see the training logs and loss curves on an html page. Use simple python server to do this. After training is done, show model results on 10 random images picked from MNIST database. Use CUDE for training. Write all the files, including HowTo.md file describing the steps.


> I want you to update the train.py file to use tdqm, as i don't want to see soo many logs. Also add logs so I know CUDA is being used.. and add logs for each step. Also use batch size of 512, I have a large GPU
 

> I want you to update the code, and also show accuracy, both in the logs as well as on the frontend.
 

> since the accuracy is in high 90s, show accuracy in such a way that we can see movements between 90-100% on the graph
